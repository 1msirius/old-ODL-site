## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to OpenDeepLearning, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

<Steps>
### Improve Educational Resources
 
Our project's core consists of courses, tutorials, and learning materials. If you have expertise in a specific deep learning domain, you can contribute by creating new educational content, enhancing existing resources, or suggesting improvements to make them more comprehensive and accessible.
 
### Identify and Fix Bugs
 
If you encounter any issues or bugs in our code, learning resources, or website, we encourage you to open a detailed issue report or submit a pull request with a proposed fix. Your contribution will help improve the overall quality and reliability of the project.

### Propose New Ideas

Do you have an innovative idea for a new course, tutorial, or feature that could enhance the OpenDeepLearning experience? Share your thoughts by opening an issue or engaging with our community discussions. Your fresh perspectives could shape the direction of our project.

### Mentor and Support

Our community thrives on knowledge-sharing and collaboration. Consider volunteering as a mentor to guide newcomers, answer questions, or provide feedback on their projects. Your support can empower others and foster a welcoming learning environment.

## GitHub Issues

Our [issues](#) page is regularly updated with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. We've implemented a labeling system to assist in sorting and discovering relevant issues. Kindly assign yourself to any issue you begin working on.

When adding an issue, please ensure it remains focused on a single, modular bug, improvement, or feature. If related issues arise or if there are blockers, please link them instead of merging them.

We strive to maintain these issues as current as possible. However, given the fast pace of development in this field, some may become outdated. If you observe this, please inform us promptly.

## GitHub Discussions

Explore our [discussions](#) page, where users engage in conversations, seek guidance on usage, deliberate design choices, and suggest innovative features.

If you're capable of addressing queries, lend a hand! This empowers maintainers to dedicate additional time to development and resolving issues.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any challenges while contributing to OpenDeepLearning, don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainer for assistance. We have a vibrant community of developers on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QgZHExcssR) ready to help you overcome any obstacles.

Feel free to ask for support whenever needed.
